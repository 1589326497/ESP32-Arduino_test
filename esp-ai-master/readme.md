> Provides a complete AI dialogue solution for your development board, including but not limited to the `IAT(ASR)+LLM+TTS` integration solution for the `ESP32` series development boards. It is injected into the project as a dependency without affecting existing projects.

For developing the dialogue functionality of robots, you only need to prepare the `IAT(ASR)`, `LLM`, and `TTS` services, and leave the rest to `ESP-AI`.

The server-side code of this project is based on Node.js, and the hardware code is based on Arduino IDE.

# Features

- [x] Customizable offline voice wake-up
- [x] IAT(ASR) ➡️ LLM/RAG ➡️ TTS
- [x] Configurable
- [x] Plugin-based
- [x] Ready to use

# Next Steps

- [ ] Provide a no-code access solution
- [ ] Integrate AI into the user intent inference process (e.g., "Turn off the light", "Quickly turn on the light", both recognized as the "turn on the light" command)
- [ ] Offer both free and paid services
- [ ] Online generation of wake words
- [ ] Support for writing plugins in other languages (avoiding the need to use Node.js exclusively for plugin development)
- [ ] Provide dedicated development boards (to avoid the current complex wiring)
